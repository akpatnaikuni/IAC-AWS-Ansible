task : provisioning of infrastructure

we need to install "awscli(command line interface)", python, boto and boto3.

Ansible server should have permissions to create ec2 instances.For that we need to create IAM role in AWS and then attach that role to ansible server.

I navigate to directory /etc/ansible/roles. cd /etc/ansible/roles

I created a role with name server-provision. 
ansible-galaxy init <role name>
ansible-galaxy init server-provision

change the directory to server-provision. 
cd server-provision

now change the directory to tasks. 
cd tasks/

create newfile with name launch-server.yml

We are including launch-server.yml in main.yml

navigate to vars and add variables.
cd ..
cd vars/
